# React-Portfolio
## Description
Update: This new portfolio is under a new application, still with a cleaner and more responsive application that my first go at my portfolio. Contact, Resume, and Portfolio Pages have been added. The media responsiveness has been updated along with cleaning up the Navbar. 

Current Projects have also been updated: StoryBook Weddings and The README app. 

Future Development will include a sliding gallery of my projects.

The purpose was to use React and advanced CSS techniques, alternative frameworks and Javascript to build a responsive, mobile-friendly portfolio web app. 
- The motivation behind this starter website was to hopefully over time demonstrate my growth in coding.
- I built this starter website as a catalyst for my portfolio.
- I learned that many techniques can be used to create similar web applications. 
- Languages Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Frameworks: Bootstrap, UIKit, JQuery, Google Gonts
